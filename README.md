### Tools/Libraries/Frameworks Used
- React
- Custom Django API that stores a plethora of products. Each product has a field for name, model, brand, price, and a pre-selected picture.

### Insights
- How to effectively navigate github forking so that there weren't any merge conflicts.  This enabled a streamlined workflow for the entire group as we spent less time going back and forth fixing bugs.
- Patience is important when setting up Django, it became counter-intuitive to hop back and forth between steps
- Returning a json response within the views.py that way you can easily access the API structure on the front-end
